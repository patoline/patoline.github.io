    <h1>Patoline</h1>
    <h2>A modern digital typesetting system</h2>
  </div>

  <h1 id="started" class="title">Getting started using Patoline</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <p>The current best way to start using Patoline is to refer to its
    <a href="https://github.com/patoline/patoline">GitHub repository</a>,
    but more informations will be added here soon.</p>
  </div>

  <h1 id="about"  class="title">About Patoline</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Patoline is a collection of typesetting libraries designed to be
    combined into a variety of possible applications.</p>
    <p>Its primary goal is not to offer the definitive answer to all
    typesetting problems, but rather to write the painful and boring parts of
    the job, so that interesting tools could be written easily.</p>
    <p>Obviously, a related (but much smaller) project is the Patoline
    compiler, which compiles a mixed Wiki/LaTeX/Ocaml syntax into a variety of
    output formats, including traditional PDF files, but also web servers that
    deliver dynamic contents, synchronized for instance with a talk.</p>

    <h1>Technical facts</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Patoline is mostly written in Ocaml, the reasons for this choice are
        explained below.</li>
      <li>It is designed to handle fonts well, in a uniform and simple
        framework.</li>
      <li>It uses fast state-of-the-art numerical methods to compute optimal
        spacing. Our algorithms will be published soon (although their
        implementations probably need some tuning).</li>
      <li>It can export the same documents to many output formats.</li>
      <li>Functions can be written with a general purpose programming
        language, which makes it easy to query for instance online
        bibliographic databases.</li>
      <li>It is designed with portability, long term archiving and forward
        compatibility in mind. For instance, the various encodings of unicode
        are already a builtin feature.</li>
      <li>The Patoline compiler uses a parser that can also parse maths,
        making it easy to detect syntax or type errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What's modularity?</h1>
    <p>Right now, the various parts of Patoline use common Ocaml constructors
    to communicate (hence the importance of static typing and module
    constructs). There are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Output formats, including libraries to output PDF, SVG (with
        typographic features portable across browsers), or more exotic
        formats such as OpenGL executables and web servers.</li>
      <li>A library to handle OpenType and TrueType (for the moment). The goal
        is to allow the user to explore, edit and use all the features of
        their fonts, in all possible scripts.</li>
      <li>Typesetting algorithms, that place figures and metal boxes
        (simulations thereof). Several typesetting algorithms could be
        written, to optimize size or learn beautiful typography using machine
        learning.</li>
      <li>A math library, that turns formulae into drawings using numerical
        methods.</li>
      <li>A library to edit document structures.</li>
      <li>A bibliographic tool, that can be extended in several ways,
        including more efficient and portable file formats, handling
        character encoding and names well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, all these components need to talk to each other nicely,
    which is the purpose of common data types included in the libraries.</p>

    <h1>Design choices</h1>
    <p>Writing a new typesetting system implies making a lot of design
    choices. They are all questionnable, by definition of a choice.
    Nevertheless, our goal, while writing the foundations of Patoline, has
    always been to make choices as transparent as possible to the user, by
    designing as many pieces as we could in a modular, replacable way.</p>
    <p><b>Why OCaml?</b></p>
    <p>Every computer user has their own preferences about the best language
    to communicate with a computer: some prefer graphical user interfaces
    (with preferences on the exact toolkit used), others like 3D gaming
    interfaces, others like object-oriented programmingâ€¦</p>
    <p>Choosing a common language for typography is a tough task. Our choice
    was constrained by the goal to let the user <em>program</em> inside the
    document, if they wished to do so. To achieve the long-term goals of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modularity</li>
      <li>Backwards compatibility</li>
      <li>Portability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>we decided to use a functionnal programming language, with types
    checked by the compiler (ensuring modularity and portability), and whose
    authors would also have backwards compatibility in mind. Concretely, the
    choice of OCaml means that even if you don't &quot;test&quot; documents
    extensively (whatever &quot;testing a document&quot; means), the programs
    inside your documents will <em>never</em> segfault or crash. Since most
    users of traditional typesetting systems are not expert programmers, we
    tried to avoid relying on their knowledge of software engineering
    &quot;good practices&quot; to achieve this goal, and chose to use a
    compiler to do that job for them.</p>
    <p>And if you do not like OCaml, you can still write a compiler from your
    favorite typesetting language to OCaml. Ours compiles Patoline code to
    OCaml in a few hundred lines of OCaml code.</p>
    <p><b>Can I use Patoline to produce commercial documents?</b></p>
    <p><em>Short answer:</em> for most document formats, yes.<br></p>
    <p><em>Long answer:</em> the current Patoline compiler produces binaries
    linked with a GPL-licensed library, and uses these binaries to output
    documents. This means that when distributing <em>the binaries</em>, you
    must respect the terms of the GPL. The documents produced, however, have
    no restriction on their license. Beware: in some cases, the binaries are
    the final production (such as in the case of webservers). In other cases
    though, the binaries produced by Patoline could produce source code for
    other binaries, that are only restricted by the licenses of their source
    code and linked libraries.</p>
    <p><b>Can I use Patoline for a huge, ten years long project that I'm
    starting now?</b></p>
    <p>Although one of the authors has written his PhD. thesis (120 pages, in
    computer science) with it, we don't recommend it now. The reason for this
    is that small adjustements and bugfixes are being made all the time, and
    working on such an unstable system can be frustrating. However, for
    documents that are not meant to last forever in time, we would be happy to
    help you with it: feel free to contact us for help.<br>
    <em>Stay tuned:</em> we do plan to release a long term supported version
    of Patoline soon.</p>
    <p><b>Your code does not seem too documented, or does not respect good
    practice &quot;x&quot; of software engineering.</b></p>
    <p>For most values of &quot;x&quot; that you have in mind, that is
    probably true, unfortunately. After two years and about 60.000 lines of
    OCaml code, Patoline is still under heavy development, simply because the
    task of writing and testing good foundational libraries such as font
    libraries, in a portable and safe way, is large. However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This does not mean that we don't plan to re-organize and document
        our code; we have already done it with each new order of magnitude in
        the size of our project.</li>
      <li>Languages with type inference and garbage collection (like OCaml)
        provide certain guarantees that probably make practice &quot;x&quot;
        less necessary to get a working program. But we <em>will</em>
        document our code, don't worry.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h1 id="roadmap" class="title">Patoline project roadmap</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Where are you going with all this?</h1>
    <p>Our long term goal is to make it easy for anyone to quickly produce
    high quality documents. This is an ambitious goal, but we have made huge
    progresses towards it. This page lists some of our next projects:</p>
    <h2>Improving the language</h2>
    <p> We are currently developping a new parser, using a completely
    different parser generator. This is one of the main priorities, since we
    cannot really document a language bound to disappear in the upcoming
    months.</p>
    <h2>Making modularity apparent</h2>
    <p>Patoline <em>is</em> modular, even in its current version. However, all
    the modules are packed together in a giant single module, for historical
    reasons: the architecture was envisionned since the beginning, but we
    wrote the code with an actual document (a PhD. thesis) in mind.<br>
    It made us define and focus on the real problems that a typesetting
    system must solve, but had this drawback of producing monolithic code.<br>
    The next step is: unpack all the modules in module Typography, and rely on
    ocamlfind to solve the dependencies.</p>
    <h2>Modular configure</h2>
    <p>Patoline uses a new idea for its configure script: we wrote it in the
    same language as the code (OCaml). We must push this idea forward, and
    write configure scripts that can be stacked on top of each other. This
    would allow to compile several otherwise independent modules in just one
    command.<br>
    Moreover, it would make the production of distribution packages easy.</p>
    <h2>Faster typesetting algorithms</h2>
    <p>One problem with the current optimization algorithm is that it keeps
    recompiling old versions that have not been modified. Possible solutions
    include:
    <ul>
      <li>an algorithm that keeps track of already optimized portions,</li>
      <li>a faster algorithm, removing unused branches early (e.g., useless
        hyphenations),</li>
      <li>draft versions based on the traditional Knuth and Plass
        algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h1 id="documentation" class="title">Documentation</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <p>If you want to learn more about Patoline, you can read:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the current version of the <a
       href="patobook.pdf">Patobook</a>,</li>
      <li>for developers, the generated <a href="api/index.html">API
          documentation</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Like many young projects, the authors focused less on documenting
    than on implementing new features. As a result, current
    documentation is in a bad state: while it can provide a good
    starting point, the Patobook is outdated on more advanced topics,
    while the API documentation lacks many descriptions. We are working
    hard on improving both resources.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, the Patobook source itself, which can be found
    inside Patoline main repository, is a good example of a document
    built by Patoline.</p>
